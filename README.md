**General Info**

* The plugin's code is based on Alongub's [Old Timer 1.0.7] (https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=189751).
* Timer 1.x and 2.0.x records can be converted for a donation, 
 * But it's better to start with a fresh database if you have used an older version as 2.1.3
* It is completely modular and extensible (private addons can be requested, just PN me).
* It measures the time, jumps, strafes,  etc. it takes players to finish the map.
* Players can choose their level of difficulty (style). (Each style is seperated by ranking, physics, etc.)
* You can create up to 32 styles and mix their settings with many [adjustments](https://github.com/Zipcore/Timer/blob/master/docs/modules/timer-physics.txt).
* It has an advanced world record system. There are also more advanceds stats available like playerinfo, latest records, etc.
* A map start and end is determined by map zones. You can add map zones in-game ([video (outdated)] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAX7FAF_N8Q)). 
* There are also glitch map zones, that try to stop players from exploiting map bugs that can possibly be used to cheat the timer (~ zones types).
* It has a customizable HUD that displays players their current timer and other info (or if you're a spectator it displays the timer of the player you're spectating).
* It has a Chatrank system which is based on a points-system.
* It supports only MySQL and is almost threaded to prevent laggs by your database.
* It supports CS:S and CS:GO (not all features are working on CS:GO).
* PHP-Stats to show top players/maps on your website
* You can also use custom sprites for zone beam effects ([video tutorial] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uka1Iq_I6W4&feature=youtu.be)).
* There are also many other optional modules.

**Requirements**
* CS:S or CS:GO gameserver
* MySQL database (SqLite isn't supported)
* MetaMod:Source & Sourcemod 1.6.x+
* Additional various requirements for some modules
